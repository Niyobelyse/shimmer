# Shimmer Product Details Loading Demo

This Flutter app demonstrates a modern shimmer loading effect for a product details page, similar to what you see in popular e-commerce apps. The shimmer effect provides a visually appealing placeholder while real content is loading.

## Features

- **Shimmer Loading Animation:** Uses the [`shimmer`](https://pub.dev/packages/shimmer) package to animate placeholders for product images, titles, prices, ratings, and action buttons.
- **Product Details Skeleton:** Mimics a real product details page layout with placeholders for all major UI elements.
- **Customizable Shimmer:** Easily adjust shimmer color, speed, and enable/disable animation.
- **Responsive Layout:** Works on mobile, desktop, and web.
